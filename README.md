# YoloV4 Vehicle detection and count
I have created an 2 stage solution for the Vehicle count. 

1. Createing and object detection model using YOLO
2. Counting the object for each class. 

This model is not detecting the object as I am nto able to get the GPU for not maroe than 2-3 hours and it reaches the daily limit.
hence I have used the half trained model for indicating the solution approach.
